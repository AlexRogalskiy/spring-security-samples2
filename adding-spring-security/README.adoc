= Adding Spring Security

Adding Spring Security to an existing application can be quite a daunting prospect.
Merely adding the required dependencies to your project sets off a chain of events which can break your application and tests.

Maybe you're suddenly shown a login prompt which expects a generated password logged on startup. +
Maybe your tests now get the dreaded `401 Unauthorized`, or a `403 Forbidden`. +
Maybe you get a `ClassCastException` when trying to use your `Authentication#getPrincipal()`. +

Either way, this post is here to help to walk you through adding Spring Security to an existing application,
by explaining what happens when you first add the dependencies, what to do next, and how to fix your tests.
