= Spring Security Samples

A collection of Spring Security samples; Part of a https://blog.jdriven.com/category/security/[JDriven Spring Security blog series].

The project is divided into separate submodules, each of which demonstrates a single feature in isolation.
While submodules can be combined to form a larger solution, we thought separating the functionality would make it easier to comprehend and extend.
