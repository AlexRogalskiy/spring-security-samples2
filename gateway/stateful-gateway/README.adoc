= Stateless Gateway

...

== Set-up

The basic set-up we are going for is:

* gateway at localhost:8080
* service1 at localhost:8081
* keycloak at localhost:8180

run `docker-compose up -d` to start a local keycloak server on port 8180

create a realm called `service` with a client called `gateway` with secret `42aad01b-414e-4a80-8e6d-7b9332b3aebe` and create a user.

run `GatewayApplication` to start the gateway

run `nc -l localhost 8081` to fake a backend service1 to listen to the proxied request.
