= Stateless Gateway

== Set-up

The basic set-up we are going for is:

* gateway at localhost:8080
* dummy service at localhost:8081
* keycloak at localhost:8180

run `docker-compose up -d` to start a local keycloak server on port 8180

* create a realm called `service` 
* a client called `gateway` with secret `42aad01b-414e-4a80-8e6d-7b9332b3aebe` (or change the secret in the application.yml) 
* create a user to login with

run `GatewayApplication` to start the gateway

run `DummyApplication` to start the service1 dummy backend service

Note that if you just want to look at how a request with token to the backend looks like you could also just run netcat instead of the dummy-service using:

`nc -l localhost 8081`
